      paraOne: `WSJ Noted. is a new product from WSJâ€“a digital magazine that reports on what it's like to be young
      in today's world. I was the product designer for this project, working with design directors and an international team 
      of engineers to create a new experience for a younger audience.`,
      paraTwo: `We created a new brand that could attract young readers and fits within the current 
      WSJ visual identity. We ran a branding workshop and got user validation from our UX and marketing teams to 
      solidify the final direction of visual elements to be used. With branding in place, 
      existing templates and components from other WSJ products were adapted and modified accordingly to match the new style.`,
      paraThree: `The approach for the WSJ Noted. designs revolved around the reusability of components 
      that existed within the WSJ product ecosystem, along with a system to create new components that can be shared 
      back into that ecosystem. Based on user research, we were able to map the habits of our target audience with
      how they currently use our core product offering in order to find the best existing components to use. 
      Filling in gaps of what was missing allowed us to craft a more enjoyable and user friendly experience.`,
      paraFour: `Along with the new content being produced, WSJ Noted. is acting as an incubator for 
      new forms of storytelling and features. It has also allowed us to solidify a direction for the 
      larger WSJ design system based on common components that were used in building this product.`,

      It's a real-time tracker for NYC public transportation that lets me know the best time to leave my apartment to catch the train. The current iteration
      only takes advantage of the G train since that's the closest train for me, but it can be modified to pull in data from any train or
      bus schedule. It's built using a Raspberry Pi with a few Node.js and C++ libraries to pull in the data and connect it to the LED matrices.`,

      Songwriting Without Boundaries. I originally built this for myself and other writer friends to practice a specific type of writing called object
      writing, specifically meant to focus on your senses. The app generates a random prompt based on a list of adjectives and verbs and then starts a timed writing session.`,
      paraTwo: `I'm currently expanding it out into something more robust which will connect the entries to a database, include different types of writing 
      exercises and create the option for an empty space to journal thoughts. The current iteration uses vanilla Javascript and localStorage, but I'm transiting to a Firebase
      database and React. Also working on workshopping an actual name for this thing.`,

      that typically does not engage with WSJ content. This in turn helped inform overall company strategy moving forward and the insights carried over to my role as a Product Designer for young audiences.`,

      to help with the task to create something not only pleasing to the eye, but to connect the digital world to the physical. This post-it art was a Snapchat code
      that you could actually scan to add us (redpepper) as a friend on the app. The tech I used here was nothing more than a few (a lot) of post-it notes. And a handy enterprise 
      Ricoh printer that we never had problems with..`,
